        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1/3rd cup white rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>

            <li>2 quarts chicken or beef stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First we need to make the soup base:
                Heat neutral oil in a large pot, 5 quart, over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until tender, 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.
                Add stock, water and tomato sauce, bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer, add carrots.
            </li>
            <li>Next we prepare the meatballs:
                Mix the uncooked rice into the ground beef in a large bowl, along with parsley, salt and pepper. Mix in raw egg. Form 1 inch meatballs.
            </li>
            <li>Add the meatballs to the soup:
                Gently add the meatballs to the simmering soup, one at a time. Cover and let simmer for half an hour.
                Add peas at the end of cooking, season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Serve:
                Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro.
            </li>

        </ol>
