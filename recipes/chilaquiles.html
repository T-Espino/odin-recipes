        <p> Chilaquiles are a classic Mexican breakfast made from tortilla, egg, salsa and hard cheese. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tortilla</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Salsa</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First take four tortillas and position them atop each other on a cutting surface</li>
            <li>Then cut the tortillas into smaller peices, this is typically done as triangles but any shape thats roughly between an inch and half an inch of square surface area is fine.</li>
            <li>Once your tortillas are cut pour cooking oil into a pan until it covers about a quarter of an inch of the pan.            </li>
            <li>Set the heat to medium high and wait for the oil to heat up</li>
            <li>Pour in the cut tortilla into the hot oil, make sure that there is minimal overlap</li>
            <li>Allow the tortilla to fry unbothered for roughly a minute, during this time you may prepare the eggs</li>
            <li>Take 2 eggs and beat them inside of a bowl until the yolk and egg whites have fully mixed</li>
            <li>By the time the eggs have been fully beat it should be time to flip the tortilla that have been frying. Flip over the tortillas they should be slightly clumped together which will make flipping them easier</li>
            <li>Pour the egg in over the frying tortillas and lower the temperature to medium low</li>
            <li>Take your salsa and add it into the pan to taste, it should be enough to cover all the tortilla chips, be mindful of oil splashing</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve the Chilaquiles on a plate, crumple the cheese over the top using either your hands or a cheese grater</li>
        </ol>
